<h1>Undergraduate Programs</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>1.Regular Undergraduate</h3>
<p>Placements to all regular undergraduate programs are processed through the Ministry of Education. 
    The university then conducts admission and enrollment to the different programs based on results of the 
    Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Certificate Examination (EHEECE), the choice of the student and the capacity 
    of Departments/Schools/Centers. Foreign examinations results must be certified by the ministry of education
     for their equivalency to the EHEECE. Admissions and enrolments to all programs are processed by the 
     University Registrar in consultation with the academic units concerned and by the decision of the Senate standing 
     committee called Admission and Enrollment Committee (AEC).

Criteria for special admissions to individual programs such as special needs education, music, fine arts and design, 
theatrical arts, educational planning and management, and architecture are determined by the concerned Colleges and 
Departments and may require a separate entrance examination which will be administered by the respective Departments.</p>
<hr/>

<p>There are four categories in which an applicant may join the undergraduate extension/distance program, namely, those who have completed preparatory high school, TVET complete (10+3 and 10+4), COC exam result level 3 and above, and bachelor’s degree holders.

An applicant who has successfully completed preparatory high school must satisfy the following criteria for consideration for the Distance Learning Undergraduate Program.     The University may limit how many years back it will go in accepting an EHEEE score.

An applicant who has successfully completed a TVET and CoC from an accredited university/college must satisfy the following criteria for the Etension/Distance Education in Undergraduate Program. Exceptions to these criteria may apply for those whose diploma training is in agriculture or those who are teachers employed of the Ministry of Education and aspire to upgrade their qualification in their original major field of study (in which case COC examination is not required).

A fourth variety of admission is for students who are admitted to a regular program in a recognized university/college but discontinued for various reasons. Such students can apply their study. The student should present official transcript.

Admission is granted on a competitive basis in each category. Moreover, depending on the number of applicants in each category, preference may be made for applicants with EHEEE scores, TVET completed and bachelor’s degree, in that order. Admissions to all Distance Education Undergraduate Programs are determined by the Admissions and Enrolment Committee (AEC) of the University Senate. The decision of this Committee is final.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>3.In-Service Undergraduate</h3>
<p>Currently, the only way in which a student may gain admission to any kremt undergraduate program is through the Ministry of Education (MoE). The possibility is generally open for teachers employed by the MoE and eligible to upgrade their qualifications.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>4.Advanced standing</h3>
<p>Advanced standing admissions may be allowed in some field of studies.
 However, the student must produce a certificate and a passing result in
 the Certificate of Competence (COC) examination with at least two years of services. 
A student admitted to an undergraduate program on advanced standing basis shall stay for
a minimum of three semesters as regular student in the program to which he has been admitted
 before he is awarded with a degree. Exception to this rule shall be approved by the Academic Standards 
and Curriculum Review Committee (ASCRC) of the Senate.</p>
